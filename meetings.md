# DRDS Meetings

## Work Cycle Planning Meetings

At the end of each work cycle, the DRDS team meets to plan for an upcoming cycle.  A running agenda and notes document is internally maintained by the team.  Going into the meeting, there is an expectation that the team is aware of the primary focus of the work cycle to be planned, in terms of services/applications.

At each meeting, the team works from the [DRDS Work Cycle ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/drds-work-cycle-613b7b006feafc0013132d52/board?labels=drds-workcycle) together.  One person, the driver, updates the board during the meeting and shares their screen.

1. The driver creates a "Candidates" column in the board and populate it with issues to be considered.  Only issues with the label "drds-workcycle" or "drds-workcycle-next" applied are considered; the rest are filtered out.

1. As issues are reviewed, the team adds information to the descriptions as needed so they are actionable, and then agrees on a GitHub estimate for each one.

1. Issues with an estimate that the team will work on are moved into the "Work Cycle Backlog" column.

1. Review is complete when all candidate issues have been reviewed by the team, whether or not they have been scheduled for this work cycle.

1. Issues scheduled for the upcoming work cycle are placed into the "Work Cycle Backlog" column with the label "drds-workcycle."

1. Issues to be considered during the next work cycle planning meeting are given the label "drds-workcycle-next."

1. At the end of the meeting, the "Candidates" column is deleted from the board.

### Other norms
* The "drds-workcycle" label should be standardized as blue across all repositories, with the following hex value `#2ACEF2`.

## Daily Check-ins

The DRDS Team has daily check-in meetings on weekdays, excluding Work Cycle Planning days.

The goal of the meeting is to briefly check in as a group, review what everyone is currently working on, and discuss items put on the agenda based on work from the past day.  A running agenda and notes document is internally kept by the team.

The team views the [DRDS Work Cycle ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/drds-work-cycle-613b7b006feafc0013132d52/board?labels=drds-workcycle) during the meeting, which runs as follows:

1. A Round Robin, where each team member shares their briefly shares their updates in turn, without going into too much detail but providing enough context so all team members know which tasks are being discussed.

1. Review the written agenda populated with items where input from the team is needed, keeping to the time set for the check-in (15 minutes total, including Round Robin).
