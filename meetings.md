# RDSS Meetings

## Sprint Planning Meetings

At the end of each work sprint, the RDSS team meets to plan for an upcoming sprint. A running agenda and notes document is internally maintained by the team. Going into the meeting, there is an expectation that the team is aware of the primary focus of the work sprint to be planned, in terms of services/applications.

At each meeting, the team works from the [RDSS Sprint ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/rdss-61a4f1a12a399b001730f65a/board) together. One person, the driver, updates the board during the meeting and shares their screen.

1. The driver creates a GitHub milestone for the work sprint if one has not already been created (see [Sprints](sprints.md) for more information).

1. The driver creates a "Candidates" column in the board and populate it with issues to be considered.

1. As issues are reviewed, the team adds information to the descriptions as needed so they are actionable, and then agrees on a GitHub estimate for each one.

1. Issues with an estimate that the team will work on are moved into the "Sprint Backlog" column.

1. Review is complete when all candidate issues have been reviewed by the team, whether or not they have been scheduled for this sprint.

1. Issues targeted for the upcoming sprint are placed into the "Sprint Backlog" under the sprint's GitHub milestone.

1. At the end of the meeting, the "Candidates" column is deleted from the board.

### Other norms

A sprint planning meeting similar to the above-described format takes place in the same timeslot during the second week of the sprint, to review tickets that are on the board that may warrant reorganization and address any issues that have been generated as a result of unplanned work (that is, work that came up or was escalated in priority due to needs from stakeholders, users, and/or Leadership within the last week).

## Daily Check-ins

The RDSS Team has daily check-in meetings on weekdays, excluding Sprint Planning days.

The goal of the meeting is to briefly check in as a group, review what everyone is currently working on, and discuss items put on the agenda based on work from the past day. A running agenda and notes document is internally kept by the team.

The team views the [RDSS Sprint ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/rdss-61a4f1a12a399b001730f65a/board) during the meeting, which runs as follows:

1. A Round Robin, where each team member shares their briefly shares their updates in turn, without going into too much detail but providing enough context so all team members know which tasks are being discussed.

1. Review the written agenda populated with items where input from the team is needed, keeping to the time set for the check-in (15 minutes total, including Round Robin).

### Other norms

The "Check-in and Coffee Chat" is a check-in immediately followed by a 30-minute informal learn-out, where team members briefly share things they learned that week in their work with the team.

## Sprint Wrap-up

On the last day of each sprint, the RDSS team meets for a wrap-up of the sprint with the team and other constituents, featuring a [demo](software_demos.md) of features completed in the sprint.

1. The wrap-up portion is driven by an agenda that is prepopulated by attendees before the meeting, with topics of discussion, demos of work, etc.

2. The meeting always begins with a review and summary of the latest sprint in the [roadmap](roadmap.md).

3. The meeting is open for anyone in the Library to attend, however it is the responsibility of RDSS to specifically invite people from outside of the team to attend when there are topics specific to their goals/responsibilities.

4. [Demos](software_demos.md) of software features completed during the sprint are shown by the team during the wrap-up meeting.
