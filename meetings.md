# RDSS Meetings

## Work Cycle Planning Meetings

At the end of each work cycle, the RDSS team meets to plan for an upcoming cycle.  A running agenda and notes document is internally maintained by the team.  Going into the meeting, there is an expectation that the team is aware of the primary focus of the work cycle to be planned, in terms of services/applications.

At each meeting, the team works from the [RDSS Work Cycle ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/rdss-workcycles-61a4f1a12a399b001730f65a/board) together.  One person, the driver, updates the board during the meeting and shares their screen.

1. The driver creates a GitHub milestone for the work cycle if one has not already been created (see [Work Cycles](work_cycles.md) for more information).

1. The driver creates a "Candidates" column in the board and populate it with issues to be considered.

1. As issues are reviewed, the team adds information to the descriptions as needed so they are actionable, and then agrees on a GitHub estimate for each one.

1. Issues with an estimate that the team will work on are moved into the "Work Cycle Backlog" column.

1. Review is complete when all candidate issues have been reviewed by the team, whether or not they have been scheduled for this work cycle.

1. Issues targeted for the upcoming work cycle are placed into the "Work Cycle Backlog" under the work cycle's GitHub milestone.

1. At the end of the meeting, the "Candidates" column is deleted from the board.

### Other norms

A work cycle planning meeting similar to the above-described format takes place at the same time on Mondays during the second week of the work cycle, to review tickets that are on the board that may warrant reorganization, that are off in terms of their GitHub estimate, and any issues that have been generated as a result of unplanned work (that is, work that came up or were escalated in priority due to needs from stakeholders, users, and/or Leadership within the last week).  

## Daily Check-ins

The RDSS Team has daily check-in meetings on weekdays, excluding Work Cycle Planning days.

The goal of the meeting is to briefly check in as a group, review what everyone is currently working on, and discuss items put on the agenda based on work from the past day.  A running agenda and notes document is internally kept by the team.

The team views the [RDSS Work Cycle ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/rdss-workcycles-61a4f1a12a399b001730f65a/board) during the meeting, which runs as follows:

1. A Round Robin, where each team member shares their briefly shares their updates in turn, without going into too much detail but providing enough context so all team members know which tasks are being discussed.

1. Review the written agenda populated with items where input from the team is needed, keeping to the time set for the check-in (15 minutes total, including Round Robin).

### Other norms

The Friday check-in is immediately followed by a 30-minute informal learn-out, where team members briefly share things they learned that week in their work with the team.

## Work Cycle Wrap-up and Retrospective Meetings

On the last day of each work cycle, the RDSS team meets for a meeting that is part wrap-up and part work cycle retrospective.  Each part is intended to take up no more than half of the meeting.

1. The wrap-up portion is driven by an agenda that is prepopulated by attendees before the meeting, with topics of discussion, demos of work, etc.

1. The retrospective portion of the meeting relies on the RDSS Team Retrium space for running the basic steps of the retrospective.  The Retrium space is created at least a few days prior to the retrospective and shared with the team, so that they can prepopulate it with items for the retrospective if desired.

1. The meeting is open for anyone in the Library to attend, however it is the responsibility of RDSS to specifically invite people from outside of the team to attend when there are topics specific to their goals/responsibilities.

1. After the agenda-driven portion of the meeting, the team reviews the [RDSS Work Cycle ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/rdss-workcycles-61a4f1a12a399b001730f65a/board) for the cycle that is wrapping up, to ensure that it is ready for work cycle planning next week.  This activity is budgeted at around 10 minutes.

1. After the board review, the team runs a short retrospective focused on the latest work cycle.  This process uses the RDSS Retrium space.  Time is allotted for team members to anonymously add ideas, then as a team group them by theme, then anonymously vote on topics, and finally use the rest of the time to discuss the topic(s) with the votes.  

1. In the last 5 minutes of the meeting, the team agrees upon a single action item to complete during the next work cycle, based on the retrospective.  This action item becomes a GitHub issue on the relevant board.  Action items that are not specific to an application go into the [RDSS Catchall](https://github.com/pulibrary/rdss-catchall) repository.
