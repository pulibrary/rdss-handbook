# Globus

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) is a fast, reliable file transfer service that makes it easy for users to move data between two GridFTP servers or between a GridFTP server and a user's machine (Windows, Mac or Linux). It is increasingly used by researchers to transfer large data sets because it provides faster and more reliable transfers than previous methods.

For a quick intro to Globus take a look at [Globus for newbies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d8u3KhsoX-x3k59GgWfhC7325R6616j8RytccTelPWM/edit#).

## Account setup
In order to help maintain our Globus infrastructure you'll need an AWS account with the right permission. See the [onboarding](onboarding.md) documentation for how to set that up.
