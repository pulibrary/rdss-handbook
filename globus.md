# Globus

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer) is a fast, reliable file transfer service that makes it easy for users to move data between two GridFTP servers or between a GridFTP server and a user's machine (Windows, Mac or Linux). It is increasingly used by researchers to transfer large data sets because it provides faster and more reliable transfers than previous methods.

### Moving files from dataspace to Globus

When datasets have large files to download, we like to make of copy of the data on Globus to make re-use easier. Here is how to do that:

#### THIS PROCESS IS BEING RE-IMAGINED. 

The procedure of downloading files from Data Space to a staff member's laptop and then re-uploading to Globus has been deemed inefficient and error prone. We will come up with a new process and document it here.
