# Ensembling

RDSS explicitly recommends pair programming/ensembling, especially for significant tickets. When you set up an ensemble, please post the ticket that you will be working on and the zoom link in the team channel, so that others can join if they want to.  

## Best Practices

Many best practices for pair programming are discussed in this article: https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html

In RDSS, we particularly recommend these: 

1. Pomodoro technique

    * Decide on what to work on next
    * Set a timer for 25 minutes, e.g. with the help of an [online timer](https://pomofocus.io/)
    * Do some work without interruptions
    * Pause work when the timer rings - start with short breaks (5-10 minutes)
    * After 3 or 4 of these "pomodoros", take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes)
    * Use the short breaks to really take a break and tank energy, get some water or coffee, use the bathroom, get some fresh air. Avoid using these short breaks for other work, like writing emails.
