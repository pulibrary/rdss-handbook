# Product Owners

RDSS relies on product owners (POs) to help our team understand use cases and feature requests for the software they represent.  Product owners also help prioritize the order of importance and reasoning behind that order, for which needs to address in what order.

[This video](#) summarizes some of the norms and ideas of agile product ownership embraced by the RDSS team.

 ## Meetings

 In the RDSS Sprint Planning Meetings, up to the first 30 minutes of the meeting is devoted to the PO's role, when the PO's software is the focus of that sprint.  After this, the rest of the meeting is necessarily devoted to planning the RDSS development sprint sprint.  The following norms are understood:

 * The PO brings up to five GitHub issues, created in advance of the meeting, that are related to the sprint's focus.  It is the expectation that the PO has an idea of the relative order of priority for these issues, and can help the RDSS team understand this order of priority and the reasoning behind it.

 * The RDSS team and the PO discuss the tickets and work to slot them into the sprint.  It is the expectation that issues that make it onto the sprint board will be prioritized as planned work for that sprint cycle, however they may not all be closed within that sprint.  Any tickets that remain open at the end of a sprint will be discussed and re-prioritized as part of the next sprint planning meeting where the issue is in focus.

 * Issues discussed with the PO during the planning meeting will be appropriately documented and labeled to indicate workflow needs, feedback requested, level of priority, etc, per the standards outlined in the [sprints](work_sprints.md) document.
