# Product Owners

RDSS relies on Product Owners (POs) to help our team understand use cases and feature requests for the software they represent.  Product owners also help prioritize the order of importance and reasoning behind that order, for which needs to address in what order.

[This video](#) summarizes some of the norms and ideas of agile product ownership embraced by the RDSS team.

 ## Feature Refinement Meetings

Feature refinement meetings with the PO are devoted to structured conversation about the PO's software, with the goal of making relevant features actionable.  The following norms are understood:

 * The PO comes to this meeting with up to five GitHub issues, created in advance of the meeting, that are related to upcoming work.  It is the expectation that the PO has an idea of the relative order of priority for these issues, and can help the RDSS team understand both the order of priority and the reasoning behind it.

 * The RDSS team and the PO discuss the tickets and work together to make them actionable, answer any questions the team has about them, and determine if they are sizable by  RDSS.

 * Issues discussed with the PO during the meeting will be appropriately documented and labeled to indicate workflow needs, level of priority, etc, per the standards outlined in the [sprints](work_sprints.md) document.
