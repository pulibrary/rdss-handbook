# Work Cycles

The DRDS team's work is structured in 2-week cycles.  These cycles begin with a cycle planning meeting, and end with a cycle wrap-up and retrospective.  See [Meetings](meetings.md) for information on how these meetings run.

## Norms

* The team uses a ZenHub board called [DRDS Work Cycle](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/drds-work-cycle-613b7b006feafc0013132d52/board) to track our work.  
* Cycles are delineated by [GitHub milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones), which include the date range of the work cycle and an emoji icon to help quickly identify separate work cycles.
* Any issue in a given work cycle must have a GitHub estimate before it is worked on.
