# Software Demos 

New features in our software that are completed in a given work cycle are demonstrated for attendees at that work cycle's [wrap-up meeting](meetings.md).  

## Norms 

* The team member who runs the demo rotates per work cycle.  
* The demo leader (person running the demo) at wrap-up is elected during the work cycle planning meeting.  An alternate demo leader also elected, to run the demo in the event that the demo leader is out on the day of the wrap-up.
* During work cycle planning, the team discusses what features are on target to be demoed once complete.
* The "demo" [label](work_cycles.md) is applied to issues in GitHub that refer to features that are intended to be part of the wrap-up demo.
* The demo lead or their alternate (if the demo lead is out) will run the Zenhub board during morning stand-ups during that work cycle.
