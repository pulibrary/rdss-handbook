## About Research Data and Scholarship Services (RDSS)

The Research Data and Scholarship Services (RDSS) team develops, maintains, and supports software solutions in support of research data and scholarship, especially open access scholarship, for the Princeton research community. We support the ingest, publication, discovery, and preservation of research data and scholarship content, and working closely with Library and campus partners, aim to continuously improve software-based solutions around these services over time.

### Guiding Principles

In RDSS, our internally-held guiding principles and overarching mission, in the context of our [portofolio](applications.md) and the [Library's mission and vision](https://library.princeton.edu/about) are:

- Develop software solutions to increase visibility, discoverability, and access to PUL and partner materials
- Promote the mission of open access to research, publications, and scholarship, including open data
- Reduce barriers for access to and understanding of materials
- Help researchers and scholars make their work visible and findable in the world
- Support knowledge discovery, enabling users throughout the world to utilize federated search platforms for identifying related paths of research
- Steward our materials long-term, determine and implement preservation plans for those materials, and integrate into a larger preservation pipeline
- Creating fair user experiences for equitable access and discovery
